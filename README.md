## Finnfasit.no

I created this study platform as a challenge for myself since I wanted to learn technologies like Next.js, react, tailwind and firebase.

Feel free to fork- and update it.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
